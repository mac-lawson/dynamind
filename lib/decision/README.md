# Decision

This directory contains modules for implementing decision-making algorithms and resource allocation strategies.

## TODO
- Develop intelligent decision-making algorithms for resource allocation based on environmental inputs and system constraints.
- Implement mechanisms for dynamic resource allocation and negotiation among agents.
- Write tests to evaluate the performance and efficiency of decision-making algorithms.
