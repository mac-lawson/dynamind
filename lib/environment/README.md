# Environment

This directory contains modules for modeling the environment and capturing relevant data for decision-making.

## TODO
- Implement algorithms for environment modeling, including sensor data processing and state representation.
- Develop mechanisms for predicting future states based on current observations.
- Write tests to validate environment modeling algorithms.
