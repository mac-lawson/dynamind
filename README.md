# Distributed Cognitive Agents with Elixir

This project aims to develop a distributed cognitive agent system using Elixir, capable of dynamic resource allocation in complex environments.

## Overview
The system consists of several key components:
- Agents: Modular units capable of perception, decision-making, and action execution.
- Environment: Module for modeling the environment and capturing relevant data.
- Decision: Algorithms for intelligent decision-making and resource allocation.
- Communication: Mechanisms for distributed communication and coordination among agents.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Elixir and Mix if not already installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `mix deps.get` to install dependencies.
4. Follow the instructions in each directory's README to understand and contribute to the project.

## Usage
TODO: Add usage instructions once the system is developed.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Please refer to the DEV.md file for technical information and guidelines.
