# Dynamind: Distributed Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a distributed cognitive agent system using Elixir, capable of dynamic resource allocation in complex environments.

## Overview
Dynamind uses Erlang and Elixir to empower distributed computing for machine learning models and applications/users relying on them.  


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Elixir and Mix if not already installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `mix deps.get` to install dependencies.
4. Follow the instructions in each directory's README to understand and contribute to the project.

## Usage
TODO: Add usage instructions once the system is developed.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Please refer to the DEV.md file for technical information and guidelines.
